<h1>Stock Price Prediction using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)</h1>
<p>•	Developed a stock price prediction model by integrating data-driven techniques using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). 
  Executed complete data transformation and engineered key financial features, including daily returns, 
  log returns, volatility, and moving averages (20-day and 50-day), to enrich model inputs.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  •	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and seaborn to visualize trends, detect outliers, analyze distributions, and map feature correlations via heatmaps. 
  Designed, trained, and validated the PINN model while incorporating domain knowledge such as no-arbitrage conditions to enhance prediction accuracy.

  <p>
  •	Benchmarked performance against traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Linear Regression, 
  followed by comparative analysis based on predictive accuracy, robustness, and reliability. Additionally, assessed the mathematical stability of the models to ensure 
  consistency and resistance to overfitting across various data scenarios.</p>
